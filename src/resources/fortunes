YOU WILL DIE ALONE
YOU ARE THROWING YOUR LIFE AWAY
GO OUTSIDE!
ASK AGAIN LATER
THINK FOR YOURSELF
QUESTION AUTHORITY
YOU ARE WORSHIPING A SUN GOD
DON'T LEAVE THE HOUSE TODAY
GIVE UP!
MARRY AND REPRODUCE
STAY ASLEEP
WAKE UP
WE WILL ALL DIE ONE DAY
LOOK TO LA LUNA
STEVEN LIVES
MEET STRANGERS WITHOUT PREJUDICE
A HANGED MAN WILL BRING YOU NO LUCK TODAY
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TODAY?
YOU ARE DARK INSIDE
HAVE YOU SEEN THE EXIT?
GET A BABY PET IT WILL CHEER YOU UP.
YOUR PRINCESS IS IN ANOTHER CASTLE.
YOU ARE PLAYING IT WRONG GIVE ME THE CONTROLLER
TRUST GOOD PEOPLE
LIVE TO DIE.
WHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS REROLL!
WELL THAT WAS WORTHELSS
I FEEL ASLEEP!
MAY YOUR TROUBLES BE MANY
YOUR OLD LIFE LIES IN RUIN
ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE
YOU WERE BORN WRONG
IT IS DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE
YOU WILL NEVER BE FORGIVEN
YOU HAVE NOBODY TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF
ONLY A SINNER
USE BOMBS WISELY
NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLES YOU HAVE SEEN
YOU LOOK FAT YOU SHOULD EXERCISE MORE
FOLLOW THE ZEBRA
WHY SO BLUE?
THE DEVIL IN DISGUISE
GO OUTSIDE
ALWAYS YOUR HEAD IN THE CLOUDS
